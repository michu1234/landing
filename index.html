                <p class="team__list-description">Having used discount toner cartridges for twenty years, there have been a lot of changes in the toner cartridge market. The market today is approximately a twenty billion dollar business. The savings today are significant. The quality of the discount cartridges is unsurpassed. To insure your complete satisfaction in purchasing discount toner, take a minute to make an informed choice.

                    Discount toner cartridges were originally sold as recycled toner cartridges. The basic recycling method consisted of drilling a hole in the cartridge and refilling it with toner. Once the cartridge was filled, the hole was plugged. This toner cartridge was then sold to the consumer as a great deal or a “discount toner cartridge”.
                    
                    The problem was that the drill and fill cartridges produced poor quality and printed fewer pages. They were very inconsistent from cartridge to cartridge. In short, there was no quality control. One discount toner cartridge might perform great and the next may not.
                    
                    However, things have changed significantly. Today, discount toner cartridges are brand new cartridges made from brand new parts… the same parts specified in your OEM printer manual. The technology is the same as that used by major printer manufacturers. Today, a reputable discount toner company uses the same components as major printer companies. Their toner, drums and rollers are the same quality and specification.
                    
                    Know What Type of Toner Cartridge You Are Purchasing
                    
                    Discount toner cartridges sometimes has a dual meaning. When some companies use the term discount toner cartridge, they really mean “remanufactured” toner cartridges. When other companies use the term discount toner cartridge, they mean a “new” toner cartridge manufactured by a third party merchant. Both types of cartridges could be a good buy.
                    
                    Learn About the Toner Company
                    
                    Be sure you learn about the company you buy toner from. All companies are not the same. Remember, a remanufactured toner cartridge can be as good of quality as a new discount toner cartridge. Both types of toner cartridges will save you a significant amount of money.
                    
                    The best suppliers of discount toner cartridges have a quality control process in place. They insure that their toner cartridges are checked and double-checked so that you get high quality printing and the same number of pages or more. If a cartridge is remanufactured, any parts that do not meet their standards are replaced. You should be satisfied with the first and last page of printing.
                    
                    You may not know everything about a printer company before you purchase, but you can find out exactly what type of discount toner cartridge you are buying. Look at our section on purchasing discount toner cartridges online. This will give you some basic information on what to look for in a toner cartridge merchant. Good companies offer good warranties. You should always get a strong money back guarantee. If a company does not warranty their toner cartridges for one year, you haven’t found the right company.
                    
                    Do your homework. Visit the websites of several reputable toner companies. Find your exact toner cartridge. Compare prices, warranties, shipping, service, etc. If you can talk with someone that has purchased from the company, do it. Once you’ve done your part, purchase a discount toner cartridge and test it out. Discount toner cartridges are better than ever and will reduce your printing cost by half or more.</p>

                <p class="team__list-description">Large businesses require a lot of IT infrastructure and a department to look after it. Small businesses often can’t afford to have that sort of internal support in place, yet they need fully operational IT systems in order for the business to run properly. For businesses like these, external IT support can be a cost-effective yet vital resource.

                    1. Avoid IT salary bills
                    
                    Even one experienced, trained IT professional can cost a lot of money. Paying a salary, tax, National Insurance, pension and any other benefits can make a big difference to your bottom line. For small businesses, there just isn’t enough IT requirement to justify employing someone to run the system full-time. Instead, put your money towards your business, and pay a lot less for an external IT professional to help you when you need it.
                    
                    2. Online and telephone support
                    
                    If you haven’t got support in the office, you need to know that there’s someone on the end of the phone that can help with any IT problems that arise. Most IT support firms offer phone and online support and, because many problems can be sorted out over the phone, you won’t have to wait for an engineer to come out to your office.
                    
                    3. Security
                    
                    Some of the most important parts of your IT system are the ones that protect you from fraud, virus or other harm. Any software that’s protecting your system needs checking and updating on a regular basis, to make sure that your business is secure. Rather than scheduling this in for someone in your office to do, it’s much easier to arrange for an external IT company to come in to your office on an agreed timetable to keep your IT security up-to-date.
                    
                    Using IT support has many benefits, but for small businesses, the most important thing is that external IT support allows you to concentrate on your business, whilst retaining confidence in your IT systems – and at a much lower cost than employing your own IT expert.</p>

                <p class="team__list-description">Computer users and programmers have become so accustomed to using Windows, even for the changing capabilities and the appearances of the graphical interface of the versions, therefore it has remained Microsoft’s product. Although, Lycoris, Red Hat, Mandrake, Suse, Knoppix, Slackware and Lindows make up some of the different versions of LINUX. These companies release their own versions of the operating systems with minor changes, and yet always with the same bottom line. The simple fact that not one of these companies are close to competing with Windows, for the most part causes the difference in market share.

                    It sometimes seems everyone on the planet is using Windows. Many say Windows is way better than LINUX because of the simple handling of the software or hardware. There are huge differences between the number of users of LINUX and Windows. Many say LINUX is far better because it started as an Open Source software and thus is more flexible than Windows. Then what accounts for the enormous difference in market share between these two operating systems?
                    
                    Windows and Linux are different in many ways. 
                    
                    1. Windows GUI is an integral component of the OS; speed, efficiency and reliability, while the Linux GUI is optional, are increased by running a server instance of Linux without a GUI, something that server versions of Windows simply can’t do. The nature of the Linux GUI makes remote administration of a Linux computer easier with a more natural feel than Windows computers.
                    
                    2. The command prompts of the operating systems are very different. The command interpreters in the Windows 9x series are very similar to each other and the NT class versions of Windows also have similar command interpreters. There are, however differences between a Windows 9x command interpreter and one in an NT class flavor of Windows. Linux, like UNIX, also supports multiple command interpreters, but it usually uses BASH or “Bourne Again Shell”.
                    
                    3. While you have to pay hundred’s of dollars for a new Windows version, you can just go download Linux. There’s no manuals or simple installers for the free version. Although there is quite a learning curve when utilizing the free package. There are some easy automated packages of Linux for low prices.
                    
                    Microsoft’s “big con” is the supposed security issues with windows. Most spyware, adware and malicious files programs work with Windows just fine. In general you do not deal with these kinds of circumstances unless you are working with Windows. whereas Linux offers a strong protection, password protection for Windows can be bypassed with ease.
                    
                    The software availability is the key to why Windows wins over Linux in this competition. Most software releases are already configured for Windows. If you chose to use Linux you must copy Windows with special software in order to use your windows based programs. You could always install Windows as a subsystem to Linux, this would take the administrative capabilities of Windows and allow them to funtion on Linux.
                    
                    If Linux is ever to compete with Windows, it must become more user friendly and provide serious technical support.</p>

                <h4>CEO</h4>
                <p class="team__list-description">Most people who work in an office environment, buy computer products, or have a computer at home have had the “fun” experience of dealing with technical support. It’s not always the easiest, or most pleasant, experience but hopefully this article will help you make the best of the situation the next time you call. Below you will find a list of things to keep in mind the next time your computer breaks down. 1.Stay calm – Don’t yell at the support person on the other end of the phone. He is there only to help and the more angry you are the less help you are going to get.

                    2.Get to the point – Ask your question or explain your situation right away. Don’t beat around the bush.
                    
                    3.Don’t be arrogant – You are calling technical support because you need help. Don’t try and be a smart guy. 4.Call for yourself – Don’t call for a friend, relative, or coworker. It’s very difficult, for the person trying to help you, when you are repeating information that you got from someone else. 5.Stay at the computer – Make sure you are at the computer with the problem when you call. It’s hard for someone to help you through a problem if don’t have access to the computer. 6.Record the error – If you are calling about an error you saw, make sure you write it down. It’s hard for someone to help you if all you can say is “There was a box on my screen that had writing in it”.
                    
                    7.Find out how many people are affected – The priority of your call can be greatly influenced by the amount of people it is affecting. If the problem is affecting a number of people it will probably be escalated to a higher level. 8.Be patient – By default, technical support usually has certain questions they are required to ask. These are not meant to make you angry, they help in the process of solving your problem.
                    
                    9.Know what kind of support is offered – Ask around the office before calling to see what kind of support is offered. Not all technical support centers offer “How to” help. If your support group does not offer this type of support you may have to get a coworker to help.
                    
                    10.*The Golden Rule*: Technical support is trying to help – The reason you called, in the first place, is because you needed help with something. Try not to make it difficult for the person on the other end to help you. These tips aren’t just some random bunch of words I have put together. I am one of the people you get on the phone when you call technical support. I have been working in a Help Desk environment for almost two years and have heard almost every excuse, lie, and problem you can imagine. For me, it makes things much easier if the caller follows these simple rules. Technical support is made up of people too. Try and treat them as you would want to be treated and I guarantee your next experience will be much better.</p>
